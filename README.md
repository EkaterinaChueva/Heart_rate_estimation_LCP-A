# heart_rate_estimation_LCP-A

This is a project done for Laboratory of Computational Physics (mod. A) course of Physics of Data master degree.

The main goal of the project was estimating heart rate, respiratory rate and heart rate variability from a given seismocardiographic signal obtained by MuSe sensor.
Two datasets were chosen for analysis – “center_sternum.txt” (sensor placed on a chest) and “4_Chest_sweater.txt” (sensor placed on a subject’s sweater).

An overview of all the project contents and results can be found in the “Project_presentation.ipynb” file. More detailed information of the "4_Chest_sweater.txt" dataset analysis is in the “Chest Sweater.ipynb” file.
